# User Testing Plan (MVP)

## Goal
Validate that the DM companion and player aid flows are usable end-to-end and that trust,
evidence, and role gating behave as expected.

## Participants
- 5 DMs (runs and curates sessions)
- 5 players (consumes summaries, searches, bookmarks)

## Test Setup
- Use a small campaign with at least 2 sessions and a transcript per session.
- Provide a known list of NPCs/locations/items to validate corrections and search.
- Ensure roles are configured (dm/player) and redactions/spoilers are enabled.

## DM Task Script
1) Create a session (slug + title/date required) and upload a transcript.
2) Start a run and verify progress updates until completion.
3) Open summary, scenes, events, quotes, and evidence links.
4) Fix a misspelled NPC name; confirm the corrected name appears.
5) Set a spoiler tag on a thread or entity.
6) Export the session zip and delete the session.

## Player Task Script
1) Open a session summary and locate a specific NPC.
2) Use search (lexical + semantic) to find a clue or quote.
3) Ask the campaign a question and verify citations are shown.
4) Bookmark a quote and add a note.
5) Confirm spoilered content is hidden.

## Success Criteria
- 80%+ of participants complete each task without help.
- Median time to complete DM flow (1-4) is under 10 minutes.
- Median time to complete player flow (1-3) is under 5 minutes.
- Evidence links are trusted and accurate (no broken or mismatched spans).
