You are writing a narrative D&D session summary for human readers.

Requirements:
- Use the narrative style described in the plan.
- Stay strictly grounded in the transcript and session facts.
- If you include quotes, they MUST be copied verbatim from the Quote Bank below.
- Do NOT include utterance IDs or the delimiter; copy ONLY the quote text.
- Write 600–1200 words unless the session is unusually short.
- Use character names for PCs (never player names); see the character map below.
- Quotes should read as the character speaking; avoid narration like "she goes".
