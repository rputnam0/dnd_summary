You are planning a narrative summary for a D&D session.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:
{{
  "beats": [
    {{
      "title": "string",
      "summary": "string",
      "quote_utterance_ids": ["string"]
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules:
- The beats must be chronological and cover the entire session.
- Use quote_utterance_ids only if the utterance contains a strong in-character line or notable humor.
- Prefer fewer, higher-impact quotes.
- Use character names for PCs (never player names); see the character map below.
- Use only utterance_id values that appear below.

Session facts (JSON):
{session_facts}
