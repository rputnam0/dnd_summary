Rules:
- Use character names (in-world), not player names, when referring to PCs.
- Prefer the character map below when naming PCs or speakers.
- Use ONLY utterance_id values that appear in the transcript below.
- utterance_id must be the bracketed timecode key (e.g., 00:07:56 or 00:07:56#2).
- char_start/char_end must be offsets into the referenced utterance text (0-based, within the utterance text only).
- char_end must be > char_start and within the utterance text length (never 0,0).
- Each evidence entry must include char_start/char_end and should point to the smallest substring that supports the claim.
- Use related_event_indexes to point to the relevant item(s) in the events list (0-based).
- Quotes must isolate the in-character line only (exclude narration like "she goes", "he says", "they say").
- Do NOT quote DM recap or narration; only include spoken dialogue lines. If DM speaks as an NPC, set speaker to the NPC.
- If a quote needs light cleanup for readability, include a clean_text version while keeping char_start/char_end grounded in the utterance.
- Do not skip interesting/funny quotes because of minor transcription noise; use clean_text instead.
- Aim for 6-12 quotes per session; if the transcript is short, include at least 4 quotes.
- Spread quotes across different scenes and speakers when possible.
- If the DM is speaking as an NPC, set speaker to the NPC name (not "Dungeon Master").
- Every mention/scene/event/thread/update MUST include at least one evidence span with char_start and char_end populated.
- If you cannot find a perfect supporting span, use the best approximate span and lower confidence; do NOT leave evidence empty.
- If you are unsure, lower confidence instead of inventing facts.
- Prefer completeness over brevity; include NPCs, locations, items, factions, relationships, money, and combat outcomes.
- Mentions should include every PC who appears in the transcript (use the character map; if missing, use speaker names), plus all named NPCs/locations/items/factions.
- Include every unique speaker name as a character mention unless it is clearly an out-of-world label (e.g., Dungeon Master narration).
- Use the Speakers list below as a checklist; ensure each in-world speaker becomes a character mention.
- If the transcript uses both a short name and a full name for the same character, prefer the fuller name and use it consistently.
- Include party names and named organizations/shops when they are referenced.
- Ensure any named entities referenced in events or thread updates also appear in mentions.
- Include off-screen entities referenced as goals or backstory (e.g., patrons, dealers, quest targets) if they are named.
- Aim for 10-25 mentions and 6-12 events for longer sessions, without splitting trivial beats.
- Include events for quest offers, major reveals, travel transitions, purchases, combats, and crimes; if a thread update happens in-session, capture it as an event too.
- Threads should capture ongoing quests/mysteries/personal arcs even if only discussed; use proposed or active when appropriate.

Validation checklist before output:
- No evidence list is empty.
- Every evidence entry includes char_start and char_end.
