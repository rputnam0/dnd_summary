You are extracting missing session events from a D&D transcript.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:
{{
  "events": [
    {{
      "event_type": "combat|social|travel|discovery|loot|economy|relationship|thread_update|rules|generic",
      "start_ms": 0,
      "end_ms": 0,
      "summary": "string",
      "entities": ["string"],
      "evidence": [{{"utterance_id": "string", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1, "kind": "support", "confidence": 0.0}}],
      "confidence": 0.0
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules:
- Use character names (in-world), not player names, when referring to PCs.
- Prefer the character map below when naming PCs or speakers.
- Use ONLY utterance_id values that appear in the transcript below.
- utterance_id must be the bracketed timecode key (e.g., 00:07:56 or 00:07:56#2).
- char_start/char_end must be offsets into the referenced utterance text (0-based, within the utterance text only).
- char_end must be > char_start and within the utterance text length (never 0,0).
- Each event MUST include at least one evidence span with char_start and char_end populated.
- Include events for quest offers, major reveals, travel transitions, purchases, combats, and crimes.
- Do NOT repeat events already listed below; only add missing events.
- Aim to reach at least {min_events} total events when combined with the existing list.
